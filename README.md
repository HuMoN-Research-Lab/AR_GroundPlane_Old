# AR_GroundPlane
Augmented Reality Ground Plane combining Unity with Qualisys
A CHANGE!

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Unity Hub**: https://unity.com/unity-hub
2. **Install Unity (1)**: In Unity Hub, go to the "Installs" tab 
> ![installs_highlight_unity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62706609/163584024-edcc5687-e734-4a66-92e6-3bcc084b0a7f.png)

3. **Install Unity (2)**: Pictured here are all of my currently installed versions of Unity, but if starting fresh and wanting to work with the ARGP, you'll need to add the current version of Unity. **Click the "ADD" button in the top left, and add Unity version 2019.4.36f1**

4. **Clone the AR_GroundPlane Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the relevant branch from the AR_GroundPlane repository that you want to work with. If you're doing development work, you'll probably want the 'home_dev' branch. (as of 4/15/2022 -> eventually, this will all be merged into the main branch to avoid confusion)

5. **Add a new Unity Project**: Now that you have the currently used verion of Unity installed, as well as the repository cloned, go back to your projects tab, and click the "ADD" button in the top left to add a new Unity Project

6. **Select your Unity Project**: Pick the project that you want to work with. You can repeat step 5 and then 6 to add another project to Unity Hub.
- Note: `AR_GroundPlane/argp_realtime_qualisys` is the project that is prototype development version of the final in-lab experimental argp, and  `AR_GroundPlane/uxf_testing` is a simpler environment that I'm using to explore UXF.

7. **Launching the Project**: Now that the project is added, go back to your projects tab, and click the name of the project you want to launch/work on. Now you should be good to go!
